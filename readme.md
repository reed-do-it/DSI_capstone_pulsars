# Pulsar Detection
## Problem Description
Pulsar stars are difficult to detect through RFI noise.  They emit radiation at a certain frequency as they rotate, but that frequency changes.

The goal of this project is to use data gathered from large radio telescopes and attempt to cluster the observations of noise from the observations of an actual pulsar star.
